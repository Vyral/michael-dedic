Before you buy a home, there are three things that you absolutely must do:

**1\. Find out what you can afford**. I don’t know how many times I’ve been out with clients to look for homes, only to find the perfect home just before learning that it’s out of their price range. Alternatively, some buyers find a home they like, only to find out they could have been searching in a higher price range.<br><br>**2\. Meet with your lender.** Actually sitting down for a talk with your lender will help you figure out what your monthly payment would be after buying a home, as well as the maximum price you could pay for a home. If you supply the proper documentation, you'll be able to obtain a pre-approval, which will allow us to act quickly in making an offer on a house you love.<br><br>**3\. Find the perfect real estate agent.** Make sure you work with an agent who has expert negotiating skills. Your Realtor should call the agent ahead of time before you make any offers. Some people just shoot out an offer and hope for the best; you need to find out what the seller is actually looking for and craft your offer to appeal to them most.

You also need to work with an agent who has good communication skills. Throughout the process, the Realtor should communicate with you continually to keep you in the know about the transaction from beginning to end.

If you have any questions about buying a home or if you need your own real estate agent to help you succeed, reach out to me. I’d love to help you.<br>&nbsp;
