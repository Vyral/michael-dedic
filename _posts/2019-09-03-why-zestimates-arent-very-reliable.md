Once again, Randall Scott has joined me to answer the question, “Can you trust a Zestimate?”

**The short answer is no.** You have to be very careful because websites like Zillow use an algorithm to determine home value that can’t possibly be 100% accurate. They can get close with their estimates in some cases, but it’s very difficult to get an accurate price online. The better route is to get an actual value assessment from a real estate professional.

**A lot of the data they use is outdated or inaccurate.** It’s a good starting point, but you need an expert’s advice in order to determine an accurate price.
