Many people are curious as to what steps go into the homebuying process, so today we’ll walk you through a general overview of what to expect.&nbsp;

**When our team assists people with the home buying process, the first step we like to take is to send them a list of available homes in our area that meet their search criteria.&nbsp;**

Then, we ask that they choose three or four properties from that list for us to see in person.&nbsp;

Once the buyer has found a home they like, the next step is to make an offer. Generally, in the process of getting this offer accepted, **our team can negotiate for the buyer to get some money back in the form of closing costs to be paid out by the seller.&nbsp;**

After going under contract, you’ll enter escrow, during which you’ll go through the inspection and appraisal, among other steps. Essentially, inspections verify the condition of the home while appraisals verify the value.&nbsp;

The entire escrow process will take about three or four weeks, after which you’ll be able to close. At closing, all you’ll need to do is to visit the title company on a previously agreed-upon date and sign all the loan documents, as well as the deed. And that’s all it takes. **After that, you can get your keys and start moving in to your new home\!**
